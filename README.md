# effect-util

This repository consists of a number of type classes which add behaviours to a generic `F[_]` type in your cats-effect projects.
Each type class will be deployed to bintray as an independent jar to minimise transitive dependency issues if you only
want to use some of the library.

This README is going to look a bit odd until I actually fill in the components, please bear with me.
